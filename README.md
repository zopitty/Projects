## Project 1: Mastermind

Mastermind is a code-breaking game where a code is generated and hidden from the player. In this version, the player has 10 tries to get the hidden code. Players are given hints after each submitted code. Red tells the player they have 1 hit in the correct position and correct colour. White tell the player they have the correct colour but in the wrong position. Codes are made up of 4 code pegs. Duplicates are allowed.
